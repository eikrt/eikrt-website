        <h3> Mechaball </h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/eikrt/mechaball"> Github link </a>
        <p> If you haven't played Breakout or it's huge offspring, you have missed a slice of history. Breakout has numerous follow-ups, Arkanoid being the most famous of them. My favourite iteration of the concept is DX-Ball</p>
        <img src="res/mechaball_screenshot1.png"></img>
        <p> My take on "ball and paddle" genre is Mechaball. Mechaball is written in Python and uses the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=concepts-curses-library"> curses </a> library. The program is pretty simple, but needs some elegance here and there. Ball reflection mechanic is also pretty dull.</p>
        <p>You can clone the repository or <code> ssh mechaball@eikrt.com </code>. Hope you enjoy my little game!</p>

        <h3> Mechants </h3>
        <a href="https:/github.com/eikrt/mechants"> Github link </a>
        <p> Sequel to my other project, Heartlands. Heartlands was a fun demo of world generation game concept, but I made some terrible decisions in the optimizations. Instead of fixing that, I created new project, this time written in <b>Rust</b>.<p>
        <p> More information in github repo! </p>

            <p> For a long time I have wanted to create a world generation software. I have always enjoyed games like <b>Dwarf Fortress</b> or <b>Minecraft</b> where events take place on a procedurally generated world. </p>
            <p> My world generation currently has height map created with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise'> perlin noise </a>. Currently there are no more features.</p>
            <p> The application is extremely slow due to horrendous optimization.</p>
            <p> The project has been rewritten in Rust and continued development in Mechants project </p>
